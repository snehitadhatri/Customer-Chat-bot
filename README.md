# 🤖 Advanced GenAI Customer Support Chatbots

This repository contains all the tasks completed during my Nullclass Internship, where I developed and deployed AI-powered customer support chatbots with advanced capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI (GenAI), and Deep Learning.
The internship was structured into 6 key tasks, each building a more advanced and intelligent chatbot solution.

## 📌 Internship Tasks
1. Dynamic Knowledge Base Expansion

Implemented real-time knowledge updates with an auto-refreshing vector database (FAISS).
Enabled the chatbot to continuously learn from new customer queries and knowledge sources.

2. Multi-Modal Chatbot

Integrated Google PaLM & Gemini AI for text + image understanding.
Allowed customers to interact with the bot using both natural language and images.

3. Medical Q&A Chatbot

Built a specialized healthcare assistant using the MedQuAD dataset.
Added entity recognition for symptoms, diseases, and treatments.
Deployed with a simple Streamlit-based UI.

4. Domain-Expert Chatbot

Trained chatbot on the arXiv research dataset for scientific Q&A.
Implemented summarization and explanation generation for complex queries.

5. Sentiment-Aware Chatbot

Added sentiment analysis to detect user emotions (positive, negative, neutral).
Generated emotionally intelligent responses for better customer engagement.

6. Multilingual Chatbot

Extended chatbot support to multiple languages with automatic detection.
Ensured culturally appropriate responses for diverse audiences.
